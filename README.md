# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis
In this Challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

The dataset had financial information about the loan size, interest rate, borrower's income, debt-to-income ratio and number of accounts. The goal of the model was to predict the loan status (healthy vs. high-risk loans) based on the dataset's features.

As a part of this analysis, I went through below stages:
1. Split the data into training and testing data sets
2. Created the label set (y) and features set (x)
3. Fit a Logistic Regression model by using training data (X_train, y_train)
4. Made prediction using the testing data
5. Evaluated the model's performance using the Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
   
## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
